# I'm [Tristen][website], and I develop web apps

### About Me

I am a recent graduate from Oregon Tech with my B.S. in Software Engineering Technology. I enjoy full stack development in JavaScript, but I particularly enjoy writing backend APIs in NodeJS. I am familiar with OOP and development in languages like C, C++, and C#. I am also familiar with ASP.NET and have begun looking into Solidity for blockchain development.
