# I'm [Tristen][website], and I develop web apps

### About Me

I am a recent graduate from Oregon Tech with my B.S. in Software Engineering Technology. I enjoy full stack development in JavaScript, but I particularly enjoy writing backend APIs in NodeJS. I'm interested in learning more about blockchain technology as well as further developing my web app development skills.

### Recent Projects

- [Ficture] - a web app for generating fantasy maps using machine learning
- [openchess] - an API for generating SVGs of 8x8 board games
